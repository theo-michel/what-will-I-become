EXAMPLE_PROGRAM = """Lifestyle
    Establish a regular sleep schedule: Maintain a consistent sleep-wake cycle, even on weekends, to regulate your body's natural sleep-wake rhythm.
    Optimize your sleep environment: Create a relaxing bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could include taking a warm bath, reading a book, or listening to calming music.
    Short naps: If possible, take short naps (20-30 minutes) during the day to combat daytime sleepiness. Avoid longer naps, as they can disrupt your nighttime sleep.
    Nutrition
    Gradual shift to whole foods: Start by incorporating more whole, unprocessed foods into your diet, such as fruits, vegetables, and lean proteins. Gradually decrease your consumption of processed foods.
    Meal prepping: Prepare meals and snacks in advance to avoid relying on unhealthy convenience foods when you're short on time.
    Hydration: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to stay hydrated and support overall health.
    Mental
    Mindfulness exercises: Practice mindfulness techniques, such as deep breathing or meditation, to manage stress and improve overall well-being.
    Stress management: Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as spending time in nature, pursuing hobbies, or engaging in relaxing activities.
    Sport
    Regular physical activity: Incorporate regular physical activity into your routine, even if it's just a short walk or some stretching. Exercise can improve sleep quality and reduce stress."""
